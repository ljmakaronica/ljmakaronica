## Featured Projects

### Stem Player iOS Application
-	Developed an iOS app that takes YouTube links from users, processes the audio into 4 separate tracks ("stems"), and enables users to manipulate the separated tracks.
-	Engineered synchronized multi-track playback using AVAudioPlayer for precise control of each isolated track.
-	Implemented intuitive audio interface with real-time stem manipulation, volume controls, and synchronized scrubbing.
-	Built background processing system with Flask microservice for audio stem separation using Demucs neural network.


### Foreign Exchange Trading Platform (Northern Trust Hackathon - 3rd Place)
-	Developed a comprehensive foreign exchange trading platform using React that integrates real-time currency conversion, trading simulation, and predictive analytics.
-	Built an interactive interface with portfolio tracking, trade history, and real-time exchange rate data via API integration.
