## Featured Projects

### Stem Player iOS Application
-	Developed an iOS app that takes YouTube links from users, processes the audio into 4 separate tracks ("stems"), and enables users to manipulate the separated tracks.
-	Engineered synchronized multi-track playback using AVAudioPlayer for precise control of each isolated track.
-	Implemented intuitive audio interface with real-time stem manipulation, volume controls, and synchronized scrubbing.
-	Built background processing system with Flask microservice for audio stem separation using Demucs neural network.


### Foreign Exchange Trading Platform (Northern Trust Hackathon - 3rd Place)
-	Developed a comprehensive foreign exchange trading platform using React that integrates real-time currency conversion, trading simulation, and predictive analytics.
-	Built an interactive interface with portfolio tracking, trade history, and real-time exchange rate data via API integration.
-	Implemented an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) machine learning model to predict currency exchange rate trends and identify optimal trading opportunities. Data is visualized with Chart.js.


### Fantasy Draft Algorithm
-	Scraped NBA player stats and processed data using pandas and NumPy for fantasy score calculations.
-	Implemented a custom scoring system to rank players based on performance, injury risk, age, and league rules.
-	Automated data analysis pipeline to optimize draft strategies with dynamic player rankings.
